      <h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px;"> About Me</h2>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">By nature, I am a debater, and I have completed my graduation in Computer Science from BRAC University, Bangladesh. My passion for logic building has fueled my keen interest in solving real-world problems. In my professional career, I have developed scalable and distributed systems that provide transportation and logistics support for millions of users.
<br /><br />
Apart from contributing to the software industry, I have always sought to engage in research projects, particularly in the domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px"> Current Research </h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:3px"> Deep Multi Magnification Network for Multi-Class Breast Cancer Tissue Segmentation</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">Currently, I am studying a Multi-Encoder Multi-Decoder Multi-Concatenation network  which takes input image patches of multi magnification level and outputs the classification and segmentation of the tissue. Currently, the model can segment 6 classes of tissue subtypes. My objective is to retrain the network with publicly available datasets (CAMELYON16,17) and to include more class predictions to increase the accuracy of the pathological examination of breast cancer.

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Professional Experience</h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Engineering Manager MGH Logistics Ltd. MGH Group [Jan'23 to Present]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">Starting of this year, I have been appointed as the engineering manager of a logistics and order management platform ( <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhzC6554nGKg1rjZufO3UVJvUGfPqoj9/view?usp=sharing"><i style="color:#e74d3c">Learn More</i></a></strong>), V-SOL (A Infor Nexus Product) for MGH freight forwarding wing. Currently, I am leading the `Shipment Tracking` project for sea and air freight. I have developed a standalone microservice which pulls ship and container tracking information from the carrier's system and post it to V-SOL through Infor ION middleware. I have followed the Domain-Driven-Design with a API gateway to connect with carrier API that will consume the API periodically via a background job. Users of the platform can now view the location of their shipment in a worl map with shipment information such as date time of departed from origin port, transition port arrival-departure and destination arrival. </p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:22px; text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I am working on Exception Management service for V-SOL. The service will notify buyer and LSP users from MGH in real-tine if any exception is taking place during the total shipment process. The exceptions rules can be set by the buyer and easily changable. To notify we are using broadcasting and listener architecture and the information will be sent by organisation messaging channel such as Microsoft Teams.</p>



<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Senior Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Jan'21 to Dec'22]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At Obhai, I contributed to the system scaling of OBHAI, the leading ride-hailing platform in the country, to serve one million customers daily. Moreover, restructured the monolithic architecure by creating modular and reusable functions. I have also improved the memory management of the Node Express framework to utilise the optimal capacity of the AWS EC2 instances.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Additionally, I was one of the core developer of Cashless Payment System project. I have developed the direct debit feature so that the users do not have to initiate the payment manually. The payment is deducted from the selected payment method of the user. I have also contributed in the Payout project. In Obhai, drivers get their commission in real-time after completing the ride which has increased the trust and reliability on the platform. I developed the function to calculate the driver's balance and the amount to pay out which ensured the right amount disburesement to the drivers</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
During the time I was involved in building a ML based fare engine which utilises the Obhai customer profile and provides dynamic taxi fare based on the customer's historical journey with Obhai. The service was launched at last quarter of 2022. The service eventually increased the number of daily rides by 13%.  <strong><a href="https://big-ball-477.notion.site/Real-Time-Fare-Prediction-Model-186a0571a31b4fd8993b049f04704356?pvs=4"><i style="color:#e74d3c">Learn More</i></a></strong></p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
In addition to my technical contributions, I led a backend team and regularly conducted sprint planning, code reviews, and internal technical troubleshooting. Aside from that, I took an active role in the hiring process and training the new joiners.</p> <strong><a href="http://www.obhai.com"><i style="color:#e74d3c">Company Website, </i></a></strong> <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vC21IPxDQdZeD3h-70zP2Ezbx2d23h4/view?usp=drive_link"><i style="color:#e74d3c">App Demo</i></a></strong>



<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px;">Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Apr'19 to Dec'21]</h3> 
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">I joined Obhai right after my graduation as a backend developer. My first project was A Dynamic Commission Module of Obhai drivers. I built a tool to define commission rate for the drivers based on geo-location, service type and performance score. The method later on was adopted by other ride-sharing platforms in the Market.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Aside from that, I worked on developing administrative tools and BI reports.</p>
